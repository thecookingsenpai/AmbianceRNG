# AmbianceRNG

This is a very simple proof of concept for generating true random numbers by
feeding the python pseudo-random number generator with ambiental noise.
While is not enforced, the ambiental noise is expected to be generated by
having an input device that is able to capture sound from the environment.
A cheap and simple way to generate ambiental noise is to use a simple radio
with antenna and headphone out and to connect the headphone to your computer.
Be sure to tune your radio into an empty frequency so that the ambiental
recording is purely background noise.
